**CSS Grid Layout introduces a two-dimensional grid system to CSS. Grids can be used to lay out major page areas or small user interface elements. Where a grid is a set of intersecting horizontal and vertical lines defining columns and rows.**

## Advantages of CSS Grid Layout :

###### There a quite a few advantages to using the native CSS Grid over external grid frameworks. Some of the advantages include:

- Reduced code bloat. Rather than creating extra HTML elements to contain your grid, columns, and rows, your grid tracks are created within your stylesheet.
- Improved semantics. Frameworks like Bootstrap often compel developers to venture into divitis territory. What’s more, grid frameworks don’t always use the most semantically sound class names.
- Reduced file sizes. As CSS Grid is native, there is no need to include large libraries like Bootstrap in your projects.
- Speed of development. Once you learn the syntax, prototyping with CSS Grid is fast and efficient.
